      <description>About a month ago, I released a &amp;ldquo;production ready&amp;rdquo; Redis cluster client library for Ruby. It is named Renoir and was pushed to rubygems.org: https://rubygems.org/gems/renoir.
It was surprising that there had been no reliable Redis Cluster client library for Ruby in spite of the fact that Redis 3.0 had been released about two years ago. In fact, there exist several implementations but their README always say like &amp;ldquo;this library is not yet production ready.</description>
